# Visual Search Task Using Natural Stimuli

We perform visual searches multiple times a day. Before leaving the house, for example, we might have to search for our keys. But how exactly do 
we know where to look? Research in the field of visual perception and search has mostly focused on understanding and examining unnatural, abstract 
tasks and simplistic stimuli such as lines and color patches. This research has helped tremendously in understanding the basic properties of perception, 
however, we perceive much more than just simple lines. The environment we act within and interact with is much more complex than that and us humans receive 
input from many different modalities that help us make sense of it, e.g. acoustic and visual input. Thus, research focusing solely on the visual aspect during search
does not suffice to explain human perception and behavior in its entirety.

Vision is generally considered to dominate the multisensory perception of the world. Shams and colleagues (2000) however have shown that auditory information can 
qualitatively alter the perception of a visual stimulus. Therefore they showed that visual perception can be manipulated by other sensory modalities.

 
## This experiment  
At each time, <i> N </i> = 12 pictures are presented at random locations within a circle on the display such that there is no overlap between the pictures. 
N will stay fixed throughout all trials. Participants are asked whether there is an odd-one-out, having to indicate their answer via key-press/mouse (mouse to show were 
exactly the "odd" object is?). At the beginning of each trial participants will hear a sound that is either congruent or incongruent with the "odd picture". <p></p>

Example: 
odd-congruent trial: 11 pictures of dogs, 1 picutre of a car, sound of a car <p></p>
odd-incongruent trial: 11 pictures of dogs, 1 picutre of a car, sound of a phone ringing <p></p>
control trial: 12 pictures of dogs, sound of car <p></p>

## Hypothesis
Participants will exhibit faster reaction times in odd-congruent trials compared to odd-incongruent trials during the visual search task using natural stimuli. 
Specifically, we predict that participants will identify the odd-one-out more quickly when the auditory cue matches the odd stimulus visually, indicating that congruent
multisensory information enhances visual search efficiency.
